## My Contributions

During the development of IndieArcade, I primarily contributed to the front-end design, layout structuring, and some interactive features:
- **HTML & CSS**:
  - Designed and implemented the website's layout and structure, including the homepage, registration, and login pages.
  - Styled components such as posts, tags, footers, and navigation links.
  - Developed responsive designs using media queries to ensure mobile, tablet, and desktop compatibility.
  - Added animations for interactive elements like trash icons, likes, and star ratings.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Created event listeners for user interactions (e.g. placeholder text for incomplete post forms, star rating hover and click functionality).
  - Developed post-sorting functionality, including dropdown filters (e.g. sorting by likes, newest, oldest).
  - Contributed to asynchronous functions like `getPosts`, `addPost`, and `deletePost` to manage and display post data.
  - Formatted post timestamps for better readability.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Worked with my partner to understand and learn back-end features, including Google OAuth, database functionality, and advanced JavaScript concepts.

## Known Issues

- **Google Authentication**
  - Currently, Google Authentication does not work on Render due to missing access to the Google Cloud console settings.
  - Unfortunately, the original account owner is unavailable to provide updates.
  - If you'd like to set up your own credentials to test this feature locally, please refer to [Google Cloud Console Setup Guide](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  - For a demonstration of this feature, please see the demo video below!
- **Tag Filtering**
  - Clicking on a tag is intended to display all posts associated with that tag.
  - However, this feature is currently non-functional in the deployment and may cause the application to crash.
  - This issue will be addressed in a future update, but a demonstration of this feature can be viewed in the demo video!
